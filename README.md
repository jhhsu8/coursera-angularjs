# coursera-angularjs

week 1: In 'dishdetails.html', I put user comments and information inside the JavaScript object named 'dish' and displayed them on the page and set up angular filter and ordered the items by filter.

week 2: I used a JavaScript object in the 'app.js' to keep track of user information and comments, used two-way data binding between the form fields in 'dishdetails.html' and the JavaScript object, enabled form validation using Angular support for form validation, and enabled real-time preview of the user's comments on the webpage.

week 3: I implemented the necessary factory and functions in 'services.js', implemented the controllers in 'controller.js', configured the corporated leaders information in 'aboutus.js', and configured the featured dish, promotions, and execute chef information in 'home.html'.

week 4: I updated the web application in'services.js', 'controllers.js', 'home.html', and 'aboutus.html' to get data from the server to render information corresponding to the promotions and the leadership.
